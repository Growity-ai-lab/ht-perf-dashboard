# Helin Tunalı – Performance Marketing Career Roadmap

This repo contains the development plan and career roadmap for **Helin Tunalı**, a junior performance marketing talent with experience in biddable media, SEO, content, and social media.

The goal of this workspace is:

- To help Helin grow from **Junior Biddable / Performance Executive** to **Senior Performance / Growth Specialist** in 18–24 months.
- To give AI agents (e.g. Google Antigravity + Gemini) a structured context about her profile, skills, and roadmap.
- To generate weekly / monthly learning tasks, OKRs, and evaluation checklists automatically.

## Files

- `helin_profile.yaml`  
  Machine-readable profile of Helin (education, experience, skills, goals).

- `career_roadmap.md`  
  Human-readable 24-month growth roadmap split into phases.

- `antigravity_mission.md`  
  Instructions for Antigravity / AI agents on how to use this repo.

## How to use with Google Antigravity

1. Create a new GitHub repo with these files.
2. Connect this repo as a workspace in **Google Antigravity**.
3. Start a new mission and say something like:

   > "You are my performance marketing mentor.  
   > Use the files in this repo (profile + roadmap + mission) as your source of truth.  
   > Help me design weekly learning plans, monthly reviews, and concrete tasks based on this roadmap."

4. Iterate:
   - Ask the agent to create **weekly task lists**.
   - Ask for **mini-tests, case studies, and campaign simulations**.
   - Paste back your progress as new markdown notes in this repo.

This repo is intentionally simple and text-based so that any agent can read and reason over it easily.
